MetaItemInner : MetaItem | LiteralExpression without suffix An attribute is a general, free-form metadatum that is interpreted according to name, convention, and language and compiler version. Attributes are modeled on Attributes in ECMA-335 , with the syntax coming from ECMA-334 (C#). Attributes may appear as any of: A single identifier, the attribute name An identifier followed by the equals sign '=' and a literal, providing a key/value pair An identifier followed by a parenthesized list of sub-attribute arguments which include literals Literal values must not include integer or float type suffixes. Inner attributes , written with a bang (\"!\") after the hash (\"#\"), apply to the item that the attribute is declared within. Outer attributes , written without the bang after the hash, apply to the thing that follows the attribute. Attributes may be applied to many things in the language: All item declarations accept outer attributes while external blocks , functions , implementations , and modules accept inner attributes. Most statements accept outer attributes (see Expression Attributes for limitations on expression statements). Block expressions accept outer and inner attributes, but only when they are the outer expression of an expression statement or the final expression of another block expression. Enum variants and struct and union fields accept outer attributes. Match expression arms accept outer attributes. Generic lifetime or type parameter accept outer attributes. Expressions accept outer attributes in limited situations, see Expression Attributes for details. Some examples of attributes: // General metadata applied to the enclosing module or crate.\n#![crate_type = \"lib\"] // A function marked as a unit test\n#[test]\nfn test_foo() { /* ... */\n} // A conditionally-compiled module\n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\nmod bar { /* ... */\n} // A lint attribute used to suppress a warning/error\n#[allow(non_camel_case_types)]\ntype int8_t = i8; // Outer attribute applies to the entire function.\nfn some_unused_variables() { #![allow(unused_variables)] let x = (); let y = (); let z = ();\n} There are three kinds of attributes: Built-in attributes Macro attributes Derive mode helper attributes","breadcrumbs":"Items and attributes » Attributes","id":"attributes.html#attributes","title":"Attributes"},"attributes.html#conditional-compilation":{"body":"The cfg and cfg_attr attributes control conditional compilation of items and attributes.

This is feature gated and the exact behavior is implementation-defined (due to variety of linker invocation syntax). link - indicate that a native library should be linked to for the declarations in this block to be linked correctly. link supports an optional kind key with three possible values: dylib , static , and framework .

Two examples: #[link(name = \"readline\")] and #[link(name = \"CoreFoundation\", kind = \"framework\")] . linked_from - indicates what native library this block of FFI items is coming from. This attribute is of the form #[linked_from = \"foo\"] where foo is the name of a library in either #[link] or a -l flag.

For any lint check C : allow(C) overrides the check for C so that violations will go unreported, deny(C) signals an error after encountering a violation of C , forbid(C) is the same as deny(C) , but also forbids changing the lint level afterwards, warn(C) warns about violations of C but continues compilation. The lint checks supported by the compiler can be found via rustc -W help , along with their default settings. Compiler plugins can provide additional lint checks. pub mod m1 { // Missing documentation is ignored here #[allow(missing_docs)] pub fn undocumented_one() -> i32 { 1 } // Missing documentation signals a warning here #[warn(missing_docs)] pub fn undocumented_too() -> i32 { 2 } // Missing documentation signals an error here #[deny(missing_docs)] pub fn undocumented_end() -> i32 { 3 }\n} This example shows how one can use allow and warn to toggle a particular check on and off: #[warn(missing_docs)]\npub mod m2{ #[allow(missing_docs)] pub mod nested { // Missing documentation is ignored here pub fn undocumented_one() -> i32 { 1 } // Missing documentation signals a warning here, // despite the allow above. #[warn(missing_docs)] pub fn undocumented_two() -> i32 { 2 } } // Missing documentation signals a warning here pub fn undocumented_too() -> i32 { 3 }\n} This example shows how one can use forbid to disallow uses of allow for that lint check: #[forbid(missing_docs)]\npub mod m3 { // Attempting to toggle warning signals an error here #[allow(missing_docs)] /// Returns 2. pub fn undocumented_too() -> i32 { 2 }\n} Tool lint attributes Tool lints let you use scoped lints, to allow , warn , deny or forbid lints of certain tools. Currently clippy is the only available lint tool. They only get checked when the associated tool is active, so if you try to use an allow attribute for a nonexistent tool lint, the compiler will not warn about the nonexistent lint until you use the tool. Otherwise, they work just like regular lint attributes: // set the entire `pedantic` clippy lint group to warn\n#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]\n// silence warnings from the `filter_map` clippy lint\n#![allow(clippy::filter_map)] fn main() { // ...\n} // silence the `cmp_nan` clippy lint just for this function\n#[allow(clippy::cmp_nan)]\nfn foo() { // ...\n} must_use The must_use attribute can be used on user-defined composite types ( struct s , enum s , and union s ) and functions . When used on user-defined composite types, if the expression of an expression statement has that type, then the unused_must_use lint is violated. #[must_use]\nstruct MustUse { // some fields\n} # impl MustUse {\n# fn new() -> MustUse { MustUse {} }\n# }\n#\nfn main() { // Violates the `unused_must_use` lint. MustUse::new();\n} When used on a function, if the expression of an expression statement is a call expression to that function, then the unused_must_use lint is violated. The exceptions to this is if the return type of the function is () , ! , or a zero-variant enum , in which case the attribute does nothing. #[must_use]\nfn five() -> i32 { 5i32 } fn main() { // Violates the unused_must_use lint. five();\n} When used on a function in a trait declaration, then the behavior also applies when the call expression is a function from an implementation of the trait. trait Trait { #[must_use] fn use_me(&self) -> i32;\n} impl Trait for i32 { fn use_me(&self) -> i32 { 0i32 }\n} fn main() { // Violates the `unused_must_use` lint. 5i32.use_me();\n} When used on a function in an implementation, the attribute does nothing. Note: Trivial no-op expressions containing the value will not violate the lint. Examples include wrapping the value in a type that does not implement Drop and then not using that type and being the final expression of a block expression that is not used. #[must_use]\nfn five() -> i32 { 5i32 } fn main() { // None of these violate the unused_must_use lint. (five(),); Some(five()); { five() }; if true { five() } else { 0i32 }; match true { _ => five() };\n} Note: It is idiomatic to use a let statement with a pattern of _ when a must-used value is purposely discarded. #[must_use]\nfn five() -> i32 { 5i32 } fn main() { // Does not violate the unused_must_use lint. let _ = five();\n} The must_use attribute may also include a message by using #[must_use = \"message\"] .

In the following discussion, we maintain a distinction between arithmetic overflow and wrapping arithmetic. The first is erroneous, while the second is intentional. When the programmer has enabled debug_assert! assertions (for example, by enabling a non-optimized build), implementations must insert dynamic checks that panic on overflow. Other kinds of builds may result in panics or silently wrapped values on overflow, at the implementation's discretion. In the case of implicitly-wrapped overflow, implementations must provide well-defined (even if still considered erroneous) results by using two's complement overflow conventions. The integral types provide inherent methods to allow programmers explicitly to perform wrapping arithmetic. For example, i32::wrapping_add provides two's complement, wrapping addition.

Conditionally compiled source code is source code that may or may not be considered a part of the source code depending on certain conditions. Source code can be conditionally compiled using attributes , cfg and cfg_attr , and the built-in cfg macro . These conditions are based on the target architecture of the compiled crate, arbitrary values passed to the compiler, and a few other miscellaneous things further described below in detail. Each form of conditional compilation takes a configuration predicate that evaluates to true or false. The predicate is one of the following: A configuration option.

For these reasons, this section assumes a compiler. Rust's semantics obey a phase distinction between compile-time and run-time. [1] Semantic rules that have a static interpretation govern the success or failure of compilation, while semantic rules that have a dynamic interpretation govern the behavior of the program at run-time. The compilation model centers on artifacts called crates . Each compilation processes a single crate in source form, and if successful, produces a single crate in binary form: either an executable or some sort of library. [2] A crate is a unit of compilation and linking, as well as versioning, distribution and runtime loading. A crate contains a tree of nested module scopes. The top level of this tree is a module that is anonymous (from the point of view of paths within the module) and any item within a crate has a canonical module path denoting its location within the crate's module tree. The Rust compiler is always invoked with a single source file as input, and always produces a single output crate. The processing of that source file may result in other source files being loaded as modules. Source files have the extension .rs . A Rust source file describes a module, the name and location of which — in the module tree of the current crate — are defined from outside the source file: either by an explicit Module item in a referencing source file, or by the name of the crate itself. Every source file is a module, but not every module needs its own source file: module definitions can be nested within one file. Each source file contains a sequence of zero or more Item definitions, and may optionally begin with any number of attributes that apply to the containing module, most of which influence the behavior of the compiler. The anonymous crate module can have additional attributes that apply to the crate as a whole. // Specify the crate name.\n#![crate_name = \"projx\"] // Specify the type of output artifact.\n#![crate_type = \"lib\"] // Turn on a warning.\n// This can be done in any module, not just the anonymous crate module.\n#![warn(non_camel_case_types)] The optional UTF8 byte order mark (UTF8BOM production) indicates that the file is encoded in UTF8. It can only occur at the beginning of the file and is ignored by the compiler. A source file can have a shebang (SHEBANG production), which indicates to the operating system what program to use to execute this file. It serves essentially to treat the source file as an executable script. The shebang can only occur at the beginning of the file (but after the optional UTF8BOM ). It is ignored by the compiler.

Using the core prelude over the standard prelude is useful when either the crate is targeting a platform that does not support the standard library or is purposefully not using the capabilities of the standard library. Those capabilities are mainly dynamic memory allocation (e.g. Box and Vec ) and file and network capabilities (e.g. std::fs and std::io ). Warning: Using no_std does not prevent the standard library from being linked in. It is still valid to put extern crate std; into the crate and dependencies can also link it in.","breadcrumbs":"Preludes and no_std","id":"crates-and-source-files.html#preludes-and--no_std","title":"Preludes and no_std"},"destructors.html#destructors":{"body":"When an initialized variable in Rust goes out of scope or a temporary is no longer needed its destructor is run.

Promotion of a value expression to a 'static slot occurs when the expression could be written in a constant, borrowed, and dereferencing that borrow where the expression was originally written, without changing the runtime behavior. That is, the promoted expression can be evaluated at compile-time and the resulting value does not contain interior mutability or destructors (these properties are determined based on the value where possible, e.g. &None always has the type &'static Option<_> , as it contains nothing disallowed). Otherwise, the lifetime of temporary values is typically the innermost enclosing statement; the tail expression of a block is considered part of the statement that encloses the block, or the condition expression or the loop conditional expression if the temporary is created in the condition expression of an if or in the loop conditional expression of a while expression. When a temporary value expression is being created that is assigned into a let declaration , however, the temporary is created with the lifetime of the enclosing block instead, as using the enclosing let declaration would be a guaranteed error (since a pointer to the temporary would be stored into a variable, but the temporary would be freed before the variable could be used). The compiler uses simple syntactic rules to decide which values are being assigned into a let binding, and therefore deserve a longer temporary lifetime. Here are some examples: let x = foo(&temp()) . The expression temp() is a value expression. As it is being borrowed, a temporary is created which will be freed after the innermost enclosing statement; in this case, the let declaration. let x = temp().foo() . This is the same as the previous example, except that the value of temp() is being borrowed via autoref on a method-call. Here we are assuming that foo() is an &self method defined in some trait, say Foo . In other words, the expression temp().foo() is equivalent to Foo::foo(&temp()) . let x = if foo(&temp()) {bar()} else {baz()}; . The expression temp() is a value expression. As the temporary is created in the condition expression of an if , it will be freed at the end of the condition expression; in this example before the call to bar or baz is made. let x = if temp().must_run_bar {bar()} else {baz()}; . Here we assume the type of temp() is a struct with a boolean field must_run_bar . As the previous example, the temporary corresponding to temp() will be freed at the end of the condition expression. while foo(&temp()) {bar();} . The temporary containing the return value from the call to temp() is created in the loop conditional expression. Hence it will be freed at the end of the loop conditional expression; in this example before the call to bar if the loop body is executed. let x = &temp() . Here, the same temporary is being assigned into x , rather than being passed as a parameter, and hence the temporary's lifetime is considered to be the enclosing block. let x = SomeStruct { foo: &temp() } . As in the previous case, the temporary is assigned into a struct which is then assigned into a binding, and hence it is given the lifetime of the enclosing block. let x = [ &temp() ] . As in the previous case, the temporary is assigned into an array which is then assigned into a binding, and hence it is given the lifetime of the enclosing block. let ref x = temp() . In this case, the temporary is created using a ref binding, but the result is the same: the lifetime is extended to the enclosing block.","breadcrumbs":"Statements and expressions » Temporary lifetimes","id":"expressions.html#temporary-lifetimes","title":"Temporary lifetimes"},"expressions/array-expr.html#array-and-array-index-expressions":{"body":"","breadcrumbs":"Statements and expressions » Expressions » Array and array index expressions","id":"expressions/array-expr.html#array-and-array-index-expressions","title":"Array and array index expressions"},"expressions/array-expr.html#array-and-slice-indexing-expressions":{"body":"Syntax IndexExpression : Expression [ Expression ] Array and slice -typed expressions can be indexed by writing a square-bracket-enclosed expression of type usize (the index) after them.

Item declaration statements do not need to be followed by a semicolon. Expression statements usually require a following semicolon except if its outer expression is a flow control expression. Furthermore, extra semicolons between statements are allowed, but these semicolons do not affect semantics. Note: The semicolon following a statement is not a part of the statement itself. They are invalid when using the stmt macro matcher. When evaluating a block expression, each statement, except for item declaration statements, is executed sequentially.

( || | | ClosureParameters ? | ) ( Expression | -> TypeNoBounds BlockExpression ) ClosureParameters : ClosureParam ( , ClosureParam )* , ? ClosureParam : Pattern ( : Type )? A closure expression defines a closure and denotes it as a value, in a single expression. A closure expression is a pipe-symbol-delimited ( | ) list of irrefutable patterns followed by an expression. Type annotations may optionally be added for the type of the parameters or for the return type. If there is a return type, the expression used for the body of the closure must be a normal block . A closure expression also may begin with the move keyword before the initial | . A closure expression denotes a function that maps a list of parameters onto the expression that follows the parameters. Just like a let binding , the parameters are irrefutable patterns , whose type annotation is optional and will be inferred from context if not given. Each closure expression has a unique, anonymous type. Closure expressions are most useful when passing functions as arguments to other functions, as an abbreviation for defining and capturing a separate function. Significantly, closure expressions capture their environment , which regular function definitions do not. Without the move keyword, the closure expression infers how it captures each variable from its environment , preferring to capture by shared reference, effectively borrowing all outer variables mentioned inside the closure's body. If needed the compiler will infer that instead mutable references should be taken, or that the values should be moved or copied (depending on their type) from the environment. A closure can be forced to capture its environment by copying or moving values by prefixing it with the move keyword. This is often used to ensure that the closure's type is 'static . The compiler will determine which of the closure traits the closure's type will implement by how it acts on its captured variables. The closure will also implement Send and/or Sync if all of its captured types do. These traits allow functions to accept closures using generics, even though the exact types can't be named. In this example, we define a function ten_times that takes a higher-order function argument, and we then call it with a closure expression as an argument, followed by a closure expression that moves values from its environment. fn ten_times<F>(f: F) where F: Fn(i32) { for index in 0..10 { f(index); }\n} ten_times(|j| println!(\"hello, {}\", j));\n// With type annotations\nten_times(|j: i32| -> () { println!(\"hello, {}\", j) }); let word = \"konnichiwa\".to_owned();\nten_times(move |j| println!(\"{}, {}\", word, j));","breadcrumbs":"Statements and expressions » Expressions » Closure expressions","id":"expressions/closure-expr.html#closure-expressions","title":"Closure expressions"},"expressions/enum-variant-expr.html#enumeration-variant-expressions":{"body":"Syntax EnumerationVariantExpression : EnumExprStruct | EnumExprTuple | EnumExprFieldless EnumExprStruct : PathInExpression { EnumExprFields ? } EnumExprFields : EnumExprField ( , EnumExprField )* , ?

MatchArm : OuterAttribute * MatchArmPatterns MatchArmGuard ? MatchArmPatterns : | ? Pattern ( | Pattern )* MatchArmGuard : if Expression A match expression branches on a pattern. The exact form of matching that occurs depends on the pattern . A match expression has a scrutinee expression , which is the value to compare to the patterns. The scrutinee expression and the patterns must have the same type. A match behaves differently depending on whether or not the scrutinee expression is a place expression or value expression . If the scrutinee expression is a value expression , it is first evaluated into a temporary location, and the resulting value is sequentially compared to the patterns in the arms until a match is found. The first arm with a matching pattern is chosen as the branch target of the match , any variables bound by the pattern are assigned to local variables in the arm's block, and control enters the block. When the scrutinee expression is a place expression , the match does not allocate a temporary location; however, a by-value binding may copy or move from the memory location. When possible, it is preferable to match on place expressions, as the lifetime of these matches inherits the lifetime of the place expression rather than being restricted to the inside of the match. An example of a match expression: let x = 1; match x { 1 => println!(\"one\"), 2 => println!(\"two\"), 3 => println!(\"three\"), 4 => println!(\"four\"), 5 => println!(\"five\"), _ => println!(\"something else\"),\n} Variables bound within the pattern are scoped to the match guard and the arm's expression. The binding mode (move, copy, or reference) depends on the pattern. Multiple match patterns may be joined with the | operator: # let x = 9;\nlet message = match x { 0 | 1 => \"not many\", 2 ..= 9 => \"a few\", _ => \"lots\"\n}; assert_eq!(message, \"a few\"); Please notice that the 2..=9 is a Range Pattern , not a Range Expression and, thus, only those types of ranges supported by range patterns can be used in match arms. Match arms can accept match guards to further refine the criteria for matching a case. Pattern guards appear after the pattern and consist of a bool-typed expression following the if keyword. A pattern guard may refer to the variables bound within the pattern they follow. When the pattern matches successfully, the pattern guard expression is executed. If the expression is truthy, the pattern is successfully matched against. Otherwise, the next pattern, including other matches with the | operator in the same arm, is tested. # let maybe_digit = Some(0);\n# fn process_digit(i: i32) { }\n# fn process_other(i: i32) { }\nlet message = match maybe_digit { Some(x) if x < 10 => process_digit(x), Some(x) => process_other(x), None => panic!(),\n}; Note: Multiple matches using the | operator can cause the pattern guard and and side effects it has to execute multiple times. For example: use std::cell::Cell;\nfn main() { let i : Cell<i32> = Cell::new(0); match 1 { 1 | _ if { i.set(i.get() + 1); false } => {} _ => {} } assert_eq!(i.get(), 2);\n}","breadcrumbs":"Statements and expressions » Expressions » match expressions","id":"expressions/match-expr.html#match--expressions","title":"match expressions"},"expressions/method-call-expr.html#method-call-expressions":{"body":"Syntax MethodCallExpression : Expression . PathExprSegment ( CallParams ? ) A method call consists of an expression (the receiver ) followed by a single dot, an expression path segment, and a parenthesized expression-list. Method calls are resolved to associated methods on specific traits, either statically dispatching to a method if the exact self -type of the left-hand-side is known, or dynamically dispatching if the left-hand-side expression is an indirect trait object . let pi: Result<f32, _> = \"3.14\".parse();\nlet log_pi = pi.unwrap_or(1.0).log(2.72);\n# assert!(1.14 < log_pi && log_pi < 1.15) When looking up a method call, the receiver may be automatically dereferenced or borrowed in order to call a method. This requires a more complex lookup process than for other functions, since there may be a number of possible methods to call. The following procedure is used: The first step is to build a list of candidate receiver types. Obtain these by repeatedly dereferencing the receiver expression's type, adding each type encountered to the list, then finally attempting an unsized coercion at the end, and adding the result type if that is successful. Then, for each candidate T , add &T and &mut T to the list immediately after T . For instance, if the receiver has type Box<[i32;2]> , then the candidate types will be Box<[i32;2]> , &Box<[i32;2]> , &mut Box<[i32;2]> , [i32; 2] (by dereferencing), &[i32; 2] , &mut [i32; 2] , [i32] (by unsized coercion), &[i32] , and finally &mut [i32] . Then, for each candidate type T , search for a visible method with a receiver of that type in the following places: T 's inherent methods (methods implemented directly on T ). Any of the methods provided by a visible trait implemented by T . If T is a type parameter, methods provided by trait bounds on T are looked up first. Then all remaining methods in scope are looked up. Note: the lookup is done for each type in order, which can occasionally lead to surprising results. The below code will print \"In trait impl!\", because &self methods are looked up first, the trait method is found before the struct's &mut self method is found. struct Foo {} trait Bar { fn bar(&self);\n} impl Foo { fn bar(&mut self) { println!(\"In struct impl!\") }\n} impl Bar for Foo { fn bar(&self) { println!(\"In trait impl!\") }\n} fn main() { let mut f = Foo{}; f.bar();\n} If this results in multiple possible candidates, then it is an error, and the receiver must be converted to an appropriate receiver type to make the method call. This process does not take into account the mutability or lifetime of the receiver, or whether a method is unsafe . Once a method is looked up, if it can't be called for one (or more) of those reasons, the result is a compiler error. If a step is reached where there is more than one possible method, such as where generic methods or traits are considered the same, then it is a compiler error. These cases require a disambiguating function call syntax for method and function invocation. Warning: For trait objects , if there is an inherent method of the same name as a trait method, it will give a compiler error when trying to call the method in a method call expression. Instead, you can call the method using disambiguating function call syntax , in which case it calls the trait method, not the inherent method. There is no way to call the inherent method. Just don't define inherent methods on trait objects with the same name a trait method and you'll be fine.","breadcrumbs":"Statements and expressions » Expressions » Method-call expressions","id":"expressions/method-call-expr.html#method-call-expressions","title":"Method-call expressions"},"expressions/operator-expr.html#arithmetic-and-logical-binary-operators":{"body":"Syntax ArithmeticOrLogicalExpression : Expression + Expression | Expression - Expression | Expression * Expression | Expression / Expression | Expression % Expression | Expression & Expression | Expression | Expression | Expression ^ Expression | Expression << Expression | Expression >> Expression Binary operators expressions are all written with infix notation.

Other ABIs may be specified using an abi string, as shown here: // Interface to the Windows API\nextern \"stdcall\" { } There are three ABI strings which are cross-platform, and which all compilers are guaranteed to support: extern \"Rust\" -- The default ABI when you write a normal fn foo() in any Rust code. extern \"C\" -- This is the same as extern fn foo() ; whatever the default your C compiler supports. extern \"system\" -- Usually the same as extern \"C\" , except on Win32, in which case it's \"stdcall\" , or what you should use to link to the Windows API itself There are also some platform-specific ABI strings: extern \"cdecl\" -- The default for x86_32 C code. extern \"stdcall\" -- The default for the Win32 API on x86_32. extern \"win64\" -- The default for C code on x86_64 Windows. extern \"sysv64\" -- The default for C code on non-Windows x86_64. extern \"aapcs\" -- The default for ARM. extern \"fastcall\" -- The fastcall ABI -- corresponds to MSVC's __fastcall and GCC and clang's __attribute__((fastcall)) extern \"vectorcall\" -- The vectorcall ABI -- corresponds to MSVC's __vectorcall and clang's __attribute__((vectorcall)) Finally, there are some rustc-specific ABI strings: extern \"rust-intrinsic\" -- The ABI of rustc intrinsics. extern \"rust-call\" -- The ABI of the Fn::call trait functions. extern \"platform-intrinsic\" -- Specific platform intrinsics -- like, for example, sqrt -- have this ABI.

WhereClause ? { StructFields } A union declaration uses the same syntax as a struct declaration, except with union in place of struct . #[repr(C)]\nunion MyUnion { f1: u32, f2: f32,\n} The key property of unions is that all fields of a union share common storage. As a result writes to one field of a union can overwrite its other fields, and size of a union is determined by the size of its largest field. A value of a union type can be created using the same syntax that is used for struct types, except that it must specify exactly one field: # union MyUnion { f1: u32, f2: f32 }\n#\nlet u = MyUnion { f1: 1 }; The expression above creates a value of type MyUnion with active field f1 . Active field of a union can be accessed using the same syntax as struct fields: let f = u.f1; Inactive fields can be accessed as well (using the same syntax) if they are sufficiently layout compatible with the current value kept by the union. Reading incompatible fields results in undefined behavior. However, the active field is not generally known statically, so all reads of union fields have to be placed in unsafe blocks. # union MyUnion { f1: u32, f2: f32 }\n# let u = MyUnion { f1: 1 };\n#\nunsafe { let f = u.f1;\n} Writes to Copy union fields do not require reads for running destructors, so these writes don't have to be placed in unsafe blocks # union MyUnion { f1: u32, f2: f32 }\n# let mut u = MyUnion { f1: 1 };\n#\nu.f1 = 2; Commonly, code using unions will provide safe wrappers around unsafe union field accesses. Another way to access union fields is to use pattern matching. Pattern matching on union fields uses the same syntax as struct patterns, except that the pattern must specify exactly one field. Since pattern matching accesses potentially inactive fields it has to be placed in unsafe blocks as well. # union MyUnion { f1: u32, f2: f32 }\n#\nfn f(u: MyUnion) { unsafe { match u { MyUnion { f1: 10 } => { println!(\"ten\"); } MyUnion { f2 } => { println!(\"{}\", f2); } } }\n} Pattern matching may match a union as a field of a larger structure. In particular, when using a Rust union to implement a C tagged union via FFI, this allows matching on the tag and the corresponding field simultaneously: #[repr(u32)]\nenum Tag { I, F } #[repr(C)]\nunion U { i: i32, f: f32,\n} #[repr(C)]\nstruct Value { tag: Tag, u: U,\n} fn is_zero(v: Value) -> bool { unsafe { match v { Value { tag: I, u: U { i: 0 } } => true, Value { tag: F, u: U { f: 0.0 } } => true, _ => false, } }\n} Since union fields share common storage, gaining write access to one field of a union can give write access to all its remaining fields. Borrow checking rules have to be adjusted to account for this fact. As a result, if one field of a union is borrowed, all its remaining fields are borrowed as well for the same lifetime. // ERROR: cannot borrow `u` (via `u.f2`) as mutable more than once at a time\nfn test() { let mut u = MyUnion { f1: 1 }; unsafe { let b1 = &mut u.f1; ---- first mutable borrow occurs here (via `u.f1`) let b2 = &mut u.f2; ^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here (via `u.f2`) *b1 = 5; } - first borrow ends here assert_eq!(unsafe { u.f1 }, 5);\n} As you could see, in many aspects (except for layouts, safety and ownership) unions behave exactly like structs, largely as a consequence of inheriting their syntactic shape from structs. This is also true for many unmentioned aspects of Rust language (such as privacy, name resolution, type inference, generics, trait implementations, inherent implementations, coherence, pattern checking, etc etc etc).

The compiler supports various methods to link crates together both statically and dynamically. This section will explore the various methods to link crates together, and more information about native libraries can be found in the FFI section of the book . In one session of compilation, the compiler can generate multiple artifacts through the usage of either command line flags or the crate_type attribute. If one or more command line flags are specified, all crate_type attributes will be ignored in favor of only building the artifacts specified by command line. --crate-type=bin , #[crate_type = \"bin\"] - A runnable executable will be produced. This requires that there is a main function in the crate which will be run when the program begins executing. This will link in all Rust and native dependencies, producing a distributable binary. --crate-type=lib , #[crate_type = \"lib\"] - A Rust library will be produced. This is an ambiguous concept as to what exactly is produced because a library can manifest itself in several forms. The purpose of this generic lib option is to generate the \"compiler recommended\" style of library. The output library will always be usable by rustc, but the actual type of library may change from time-to-time. The remaining output types are all different flavors of libraries, and the lib type can be seen as an alias for one of them (but the actual one is compiler-defined). --crate-type=dylib , #[crate_type = \"dylib\"] - A dynamic Rust library will be produced. This is different from the lib output type in that this forces dynamic library generation. The resulting dynamic library can be used as a dependency for other libraries and/or executables. This output type will create *.so files on linux, *.dylib files on osx, and *.dll files on windows. --crate-type=staticlib , #[crate_type = \"staticlib\"] - A static system library will be produced. This is different from other library outputs in that the compiler will never attempt to link to staticlib outputs. The purpose of this output type is to create a static library containing all of the local crate's code along with all upstream dependencies. The static library is actually a *.a archive on linux and osx and a *.lib file on windows. This format is recommended for use in situations such as linking Rust code into an existing non-Rust application because it will not have dynamic dependencies on other Rust code. --crate-type=cdylib , #[crate_type = \"cdylib\"] - A dynamic system library will be produced. This is used when compiling a dynamic library to be loaded from another language. This output type will create *.so files on Linux, *.dylib files on macOS, and *.dll files on Windows. --crate-type=rlib , #[crate_type = \"rlib\"] - A \"Rust library\" file will be produced. This is used as an intermediate artifact and can be thought of as a \"static Rust library\". These rlib files, unlike staticlib files, are interpreted by the compiler in future linkage. This essentially means that rustc will look for metadata in rlib files like it looks for metadata in dynamic libraries. This form of output is used to produce statically linked executables as well as staticlib outputs. --crate-type=proc-macro , #[crate_type = \"proc-macro\"] - The output produced is not specified, but if a -L path is provided to it then the compiler will recognize the output artifacts as a macro and it can be loaded for a program. Crates compiled with this crate type must only export procedural macros . The compiler will automatically set the proc_macro configuration option . The crates are always compiled with the same target that the compiler itself was built with. For example, if you are executing the compiler from Linux with an x86_64 CPU, the target will be x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu even if the crate is a dependency of another crate being built for a different target. Note that these outputs are stackable in the sense that if multiple are specified, then the compiler will produce each form of output at once without having to recompile. However, this only applies for outputs specified by the same method. If only crate_type attributes are specified, then they will all be built, but if one or more --crate-type command line flags are specified, then only those outputs will be built. With all these different kinds of outputs, if crate A depends on crate B, then the compiler could find B in various different forms throughout the system. The only forms looked for by the compiler, however, are the rlib format and the dynamic library format. With these two options for a dependent library, the compiler must at some point make a choice between these two formats. With this in mind, the compiler follows these rules when determining what format of dependencies will be used: If a static library is being produced, all upstream dependencies are required to be available in rlib formats. This requirement stems from the reason that a dynamic library cannot be converted into a static format. Note that it is impossible to link in native dynamic dependencies to a static library, and in this case warnings will be printed about all unlinked native dynamic dependencies. If an rlib file is being produced, then there are no restrictions on what format the upstream dependencies are available in. It is simply required that all upstream dependencies be available for reading metadata from. The reason for this is that rlib files do not contain any of their upstream dependencies. It wouldn't be very efficient for all rlib files to contain a copy of libstd.rlib ! If an executable is being produced and the -C prefer-dynamic flag is not specified, then dependencies are first attempted to be found in the rlib format. If some dependencies are not available in an rlib format, then dynamic linking is attempted (see below). If a dynamic library or an executable that is being dynamically linked is being produced, then the compiler will attempt to reconcile the available dependencies in either the rlib or dylib format to create a final product. A major goal of the compiler is to ensure that a library never appears more than once in any artifact. For example, if dynamic libraries B and C were each statically linked to library A, then a crate could not link to B and C together because there would be two copies of A. The compiler allows mixing the rlib and dylib formats, but this restriction must be satisfied. The compiler currently implements no method of hinting what format a library should be linked with. When dynamically linking, the compiler will attempt to maximize dynamic dependencies while still allowing some dependencies to be linked in via an rlib. For most situations, having all libraries available as a dylib is recommended if dynamically linking. For other situations, the compiler will emit a warning if it is unable to determine which formats to link each library with. In general, --crate-type=bin or --crate-type=lib should be sufficient for all compilation needs, and the other options are just available if more fine-grained control is desired over the output format of a crate.","breadcrumbs":"Linkage","id":"linkage.html#linkage","title":"Linkage"},"linkage.html#static-and-dynamic-c-runtimes":{"body":"The standard library in general strives to support both statically linked and dynamically linked C runtimes for targets as appropriate. For example the x86_64-pc-windows-msvc and x86_64-unknown-linux-musl targets typically come with both runtimes and the user selects which one they'd like. All targets in the compiler have a default mode of linking to the C runtime. Typically targets are linked dynamically by default, but there are exceptions which are static by default such as: arm-unknown-linux-musleabi arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf i686-unknown-linux-musl x86_64-unknown-linux-musl The linkage of the C runtime is configured to respect the crt-static target feature. These target features are typically configured from the command line via flags to the compiler itself. For example to enable a static runtime you would execute: rustc -C target-feature=+crt-static foo.rs whereas to link dynamically to the C runtime you would execute: rustc -C target-feature=-crt-static foo.rs Targets which do not support switching between linkage of the C runtime will ignore this flag. It's recommended to inspect the resulting binary to ensure that it's linked as you would expect after the compiler succeeds. Crates may also learn about how the C runtime is being linked. Code on MSVC, for example, needs to be compiled differently (e.g. with /MT or /MD ) depending on the runtime being linked. This is exported currently through the target_feature attribute (note this is a nightly feature): #[cfg(target_feature = \"crt-static\")]\nfn foo() { println!(\"the C runtime should be statically linked\");\n} #[cfg(not(target_feature = \"crt-static\"))]\nfn foo() { println!(\"the C runtime should be dynamically linked\");\n} Also note that Cargo build scripts can learn about this feature through environment variables . In a build script you can detect the linkage via: use std::env; fn main() { let linkage = env::var(\"CARGO_CFG_TARGET_FEATURE\").unwrap_or(String::new()); if linkage.contains(\"crt-static\") { println!(\"the C runtime will be statically linked\"); } else { println!(\"the C runtime will be dynamically linked\"); }\n} To use this feature locally, you typically will use the RUSTFLAGS environment variable to specify flags to the compiler through Cargo. For example to compile a statically linked binary on MSVC you would execute: RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=+crt-static' cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc","breadcrumbs":"Static and dynamic C runtimes","id":"linkage.html#static-and-dynamic-c-runtimes","title":"Static and dynamic C runtimes"},"macros-by-example.html#macros-by-example":{"body":"Syntax MacroRulesDefinition : macro_rules !

MacroTranscriber : DelimTokenTree macro_rules allows users to define syntax extension in a declarative way. We call such extensions \"macros by example\" or simply \"macros\". Macros can expand to expressions, statements, items, types, or patterns. The macro expander looks up macro invocations by name, and tries each macro rule in turn. It transcribes the first successful match. Matching and transcription are closely related to each other, and we will describe them together. The macro expander matches and transcribes every token that does not begin with a $ literally, including delimiters. For parsing reasons, delimiters must be balanced, but they are otherwise not special. In the matcher, $ name : designator matches the nonterminal in the Rust syntax named by designator . Valid designators are: item : an Item block : a BlockExpression stmt : a Statement without the trailing semicolon pat : a Pattern expr : an Expression ty : a Type ident : an IDENTIFIER_OR_KEYWORD path : a TypePath style path tt : a TokenTree (a single token or tokens in matching delimiters () , [] , or {} ) meta : a MetaItem , the contents of an attribute lifetime : a LIFETIME_TOKEN vis : a Visibility qualifier literal : matches - ? LiteralExpression In the transcriber, the designator is already known, and so only the name of a matched nonterminal comes after the dollar sign. In both the matcher and transcriber, the Kleene star-like operator indicates repetition. The Kleene star operator consists of $ and parentheses, optionally followed by a separator token, followed by * , + , or ? . * means zero or more repetitions; + means at least one repetition; ? means at most one repetition. The parentheses are not matched or transcribed. On the matcher side, a name is bound to all of the names it matches, in a structure that mimics the structure of the repetition encountered on a successful match. The job of the transcriber is to sort that structure out. Also, ? , unlike * and + , does not allow a separator, since one could never match against it anyway. Edition Differences : The ? Kleene operator did not exist before the 2018 edition. Edition Differences : Prior to the 2018 Edition, ? was an allowed separator token, rather than a Kleene operator. It is no longer allowed as a separator as of the 2018 edition. This avoids ambiguity with the ? Kleene operator. The rules for transcription of these repetitions are called \"Macro By Example\". Essentially, one \"layer\" of repetition is discharged at a time, and all of them must be discharged by the time a name is transcribed. Therefore, ( $( $i:ident ),* ) => ( $i ) is an invalid macro, but ( $( $i:ident ),* ) => ( $( $i:ident ),* ) is acceptable (if trivial). When Macro By Example encounters a repetition, it examines all of the $ name s that occur in its body. At the \"current layer\", they all must repeat the same number of times, so ( $( $i:ident ),* ; $( $j:ident ),* ) => ( $( ($i,$j) ),* ) is valid if given the argument (a,b,c ; d,e,f) , but not (a,b,c ; d,e) . The repetition walks through the choices at that layer in lockstep, so the former input transcribes to (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) . Nested repetitions are allowed.","breadcrumbs":"Macros » Macros By Example","id":"macros-by-example.html#macros-by-example","title":"Macros By Example"},"macros-by-example.html#parsing-limitations":{"body":"The parser used by the macro system is reasonably powerful, but the parsing of Rust syntax is restricted in two ways: Macro definitions are required to include suitable separators after parsing expressions and other bits of the Rust grammar. This implies that a macro definition like $i:expr [ , ] is not legal, because [ could be part of an expression. A macro definition like $i:expr, or $i:expr; would be legal, however, because , and ; are legal separators. See RFC 550 for more information.

All other paths to these items are aliases. The canonical path is defined as a path prefix appended by the path segment the item itself defines. Implementations and use declarations do not have canonical paths, although the items that implementations define do have them. Items defined in block expressions do not have canonical paths. Items defined in a module that does not have a canonical path do not have a canonical path. Associated items defined in an implementation that refers to an item without a canonical path, e.g. as the implementing type, the trait being implemented, a type parameter or bound on a type parameter, do not have canonical paths. The path prefix for modules is the canonical path to that module. For bare implementations, it is the canonical path of the item being implemented surrounded by angle ( <> ) brackets. For trait implementations , it is the canonical path of the item being implemented followed by as followed by the canonical path to the trait all surrounded in angle ( <> ) brackets.

If a binding pattern does not explicitly have ref , ref mut , or mut , then it uses the default binding mode to determine how the variable is bound. The default binding mode starts in \"move\" mode which uses move semantics. When matching a pattern, the compiler starts from the outside of the pattern and works inwards. Each time a reference is matched using a non-reference pattern, it will automatically dereference the value and update the default binding mode. References will set the default binding mode to ref . Mutable references will set the mode to ref mut unless the mode is already ref in which case it remains ref .

IDENTIFIER ( @ Pattern ) ? Identifier patterns bind the value they match to a variable. The identifier must be unique within the pattern. The variable will shadow any variables of the same name in scope. The scope of the new binding depends on the context of where the pattern is used (such as a let binding or a match arm). Patterns that consist of only an identifier, possibly with a mut , match any value and bind it to that identifier. This is the most commonly used pattern in variable declarations and parameters for functions and closures. let mut variable = 10;\nfn sum(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {\n# x + y\n# } To bind the matched value of a pattern to a variable, use the syntax variable @ subpattern . For example, the following binds the value 2 to e (not the entire range: the range here is a range subpattern). let x = 2; match x { e @ 1 ..= 5 => println!(\"got a range element {}\", e), _ => println!(\"anything\"),\n} By default, identifier patterns bind a variable to a copy of or move from the matched value depending on whether the matched value implements Copy . This can be changed to bind to a reference by using the ref keyword, or to a mutable reference using ref mut . For example: # let a = Some(10);\nmatch a { None => (), Some(value) => (),\n} match a { None => (), Some(ref value) => (),\n} In the first match expression, the value is copied (or moved). In the second match, a reference to the same memory location is bound to the variable value. This syntax is needed because in destructuring subpatterns the & operator can't be applied to the value's fields. For example, the following is not valid: # struct Person {\n# name: String,\n# age: u8,\n# }\n# let value = Person{ name: String::from(\"John\"), age: 23 };\nif let Person{name: &person_name, age: 18..=150} = value { } To make it valid, write the following: # struct Person {\n# name: String,\n# age: u8,\n# }\n# let value = Person{ name: String::from(\"John\"), age: 23 };\nif let Person{name: ref person_name, age: 18..=150} = value { } Thus, ref is not something that is being matched against. Its objective is exclusively to make the matched binding a reference, instead of potentially copying or moving what was matched. Path patterns take precedence over identifier patterns.

Since negative numbers are not literals , literal patterns also accept an optional minus sign before the literal, which acts like the negation operator.

The output TokenStream must be a set of items that are then appended to the module or block that the item from the input TokenStream is in. The following is an example of a derive mode macro. Instead of doing anything useful with its input, it just appends a function answer . extern crate proc_macro;\nuse proc_macro::TokenStream; #[proc_macro_derive(AnswerFn)]\npub fn derive_answer_fn(_item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream { \"fn answer() -> u32 { 42 }\".parse().unwrap()\n} And then using said derive mode: extern crate proc_macro_examples;\nuse proc_macro_examples::AnswerFn; #[derive(AnswerFn)]\nstruct Struct; fn main() { assert_eq!(42, answer());\n} Derive mode helper attributes Derive mode macros can add additional attributes into the scope of the item they are on. Said attributes are called derive mode helper attributes . These attributes are inert , and their only purpose is to be fed into the derive mode macro that defined them. That said, they can be seen by all macros. The way to define helper attributes is to put an attributes key in the proc_macro_derive macro with a comma separated list of identifiers that are the names of the helper attributes. For example, the following derive mode macro defines a helper attribute helper , but ultimately doesn't do anything with it. # #[crate_type=\"proc-macro\"]\n# extern crate proc_macro;\n# use proc_macro::TokenStream; #[proc_macro_derive(HelperAttr, attributes(helper))]\npub fn derive_helper_attr(_item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream { TokenStream::new();\n} And then usage on the derive mode on a struct: # #![crate_type=\"proc-macro\"]\n# extern crate proc_macro_examples;\n# use proc_macro_examples::HelperAttr; #[derive(HelperAttr)]\nstruct Struct { #[helper] field: ()\n}","breadcrumbs":"Macros » Derive mode macros","id":"procedural-macros.html#derive-mode-macros","title":"Derive mode macros"},"procedural-macros.html#function-like-procedural-macros":{"body":"Function-like procedural macros are procedural macros that are invoked using the macro invocation operator ( ! ).

These macros cannot expand to syntax that defines new macro_rule style macros. For example, the following macro definition ignores its input and outputs a function answer into its scope. extern crate proc_macro;\nuse proc_macro::TokenStream; #[proc_macro]\npub fn make_answer(_item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream { \"fn answer() -> u32 { 42 }\".parse().unwrap()\n} And then we use it a binary crate to print \"42\" to standard output. extern crate proc_macro_examples;\nuse proc_macro_examples::make_answer; make_answer!(); fn main() { println!(\"{}\", answer());\n} These macros are only invokable in modules .

You can sort of think of procedural macros as functions from an AST to another AST. Procedural macros must be defined in a crate with the crate type of proc-macro . Note : When using Cargo, Procedural macro crates are defined with the proc-macro key in your manifest: [lib]\nproc-macro = true As functions, they must either return syntax, panic, or loop endlessly. Returned syntax either replaces or adds the syntax depending on the kind of procedural macro. Panics are caught by the compiler and are turned into a compiler error. Endless loops are not caught by the compiler which hangs the compiler. Procedural macros run during compilation, and thus have the same resources that the compiler has. For example, standard input, error, and output are the same that the compiler has access to. Similarly, file access is the same. Because of this, procedural macros have the same security concerns that Cargo's build scripts have. Procedural macros have two ways of reporting errors. The first is to panic.

Procedural macros operate over token streams instead of AST nodes, which is a far more stable interface over time for both the compiler and for procedural macros to target. A token stream is roughly equivalent to Vec<TokenTree> where a TokenTree can roughly be thought of as lexical token. For example foo is an Ident token, . is a Punct token, and 1.2 is a Literal token. The TokenStream type, unlike Vec<TokenTree> , is cheap to clone. All tokens have an associated Span . A Span is an opaque value that cannot be modified but can be manufactured.

Auto traits have special properties. If no explicit implementation or negative implementation is written out for an auto trait for a given type, then the compiler implements it automatically according to the following rules: &T , &mut T , *const T , *mut T , [T; n] and [T] implement the trait if T does. Function item types and function pointers automatically implement the trait. Structs, enums, unions and tuples implement the trait if all of their fields do. Closures implement the trait if the types of all of their captures do. A closure that captures a T by shared reference and a U by value implements any auto traits that both &T and U do. For generic types (counting the built-in types above as generic over T ), if an generic implementation is available, then the compiler does not automatically implement it for types that could use the implementation except that they do not meet the requisite trait bounds. For instance, the standard library implements Send for all &T where T is Sync ; this means that the compiler will not implement Send for &T if T is Send but not Sync . Auto traits can also have negative implementations, shown as impl !AutoTrait for T in the standard library documentation, that override the automatic implementations. For example *mut T has a negative implementation of Send , and so *mut T is not Send , even if T is. There is currently no stable way to specify additional negative implementations; they exist only in the standard library. Auto traits may be added as an additional bound to any trait object , even though normally only one trait is allowed.

A tuple index is either 0 , or starts with a non-zero decimal digit and continues with zero or more decimal digits. Tuple indexes are used to refer to the fields of tuples , tuple structs and tuple variants . A hex literal starts with the character sequence U+0030 U+0078 ( 0x ) and continues as any mixture (with at least one digit) of hex digits and underscores. An octal literal starts with the character sequence U+0030 U+006F ( 0o ) and continues as any mixture (with at least one digit) of octal digits and underscores. A binary literal starts with the character sequence U+0030 U+0062 ( 0b ) and continues as any mixture (with at least one digit) of binary digits and underscores. Like any literal, an integer literal may be followed (immediately, without any spaces) by an integer suffix , which forcibly sets the type of the literal. The integer suffix must be the name of one of the integral types: u8 , i8 , u16 , i16 , u32 , i32 , u64 , i64 , u128 , i128 , usize , or isize . The type of an unsuffixed integer literal is determined by type inference: If an integer type can be uniquely determined from the surrounding program context, the unsuffixed integer literal has that type. If the program context under-constrains the type, it defaults to the signed 32-bit integer i32 . If the program context over-constrains the type, it is considered a static type error.

(DEC_DIGIT| _ )* DEC_DIGIT (DEC_DIGIT| _ )* FLOAT_SUFFIX : f32 | f64 A floating-point literal has one of two forms: A decimal literal followed by a period character U+002E ( . ). This is optionally followed by another decimal literal, with an optional exponent . A single decimal literal followed by an exponent . Like integer literals, a floating-point literal may be followed by a suffix, so long as the pre-suffix part does not end with U+002E ( . ). The suffix forcibly sets the type of the literal. There are two valid floating-point suffixes , f32 and f64 (the 32-bit and 64-bit floating point types), which explicitly determine the type of the literal. The type of an unsuffixed floating-point literal is determined by type inference: If a floating-point type can be uniquely determined from the surrounding program context, the unsuffixed floating-point literal has that type. If the program context under-constrains the type, it defaults to f64 . If the program context over-constrains the type, it is considered a static type error.

One purpose is for creating types that are interoperable with the C Language. The second purpose is to create types that you can soundly performing operations that rely on data layout such as reinterpreting values as a different type. Because of this dual purpose, it is possible to create types that are not useful for interfacing with the C programming language. This representation can be applied to structs, unions, and enums. #[repr(C)] Structs The alignment of the struct is the alignment of the most-aligned field in it. The size and offset of fields is determined by the following algorithm. Start with a current offset of 0 bytes. For each field in declaration order in the struct, first determine the size and alignment of the field. If the current offset is not a multiple of the field's alignment, then add padding bytes to the current offset until it is a multiple of the field's alignment. The offset for the field is what the current offset is now. Then increase the current offset by the size of the field. Finally, the size of the struct is the current offset rounded up to the nearest multiple of the struct's alignment. Here is this algorithm described in pseudocode. struct.alignment = struct.fields().map(|field| field.alignment).max(); let current_offset = 0; for field in struct.fields_in_declaration_order() { // Increase the current offset so that it's a multiple of the alignment // of this field.

This differs from C where structs without data still have a size of one byte. #[repr(C)] Unions A union declared with #[repr(C)] will have the same size and alignment as an equivalent C union declaration in the C language for the target platform. The union will have a size of the maximum size of all of its fields rounded to its alignment, and an alignment of the maximum alignment of all of its fields.

Warning: There are crucial differences between an enum in the C language and Rust's C-like enumerations with this representation. An enum in C is mostly a typedef plus some named constants; in other words, an object of an enum type can hold any integer value. For example, this is often used for bitflags in C . In contrast, Rust’s C-like enumerations can only legally hold the discriminant values, everything else is undefined behaviour. Therefore, using a C-like enumeration in FFI to model a C enum is often wrong. It is an error for zero-variant enumerations to have the C representation.

The set of traits is made up of an object safe base trait plus any number of auto traits . Trait objects implement the base trait, its auto traits, and any supertraits of the base trait. Trait objects are written as the optional keyword dyn followed by a set of trait bounds, but with the following restrictions on the trait bounds. All traits except the first trait must be auto traits, there may not be more than one lifetime, and opt-out bounds (e.g. ?sized ) are not allowed. Furthermore, paths to traits may be parenthesized. For example, given a trait Trait , the following are all trait objects: Trait dyn Trait dyn Trait + Send dyn Trait + Send + Sync dyn Trait + 'static dyn Trait + Send + 'static dyn Trait + dyn 'static + Trait . dyn (Trait) Edition Differences : In the 2015 edition, if the first bound of the trait object is a path that starts with :: , then the dyn will be treated as a part of the path. The first path can be put in parenthesis to get around this. As such, if you want a trait object with the trait ::your_module::Trait , you should write it as dyn (::your_module::Trait) . Beginning in the 2018 edition, dyn is a true keyword and is not allowed in paths, so the parentheses are not necessary. Note: For clarity, it is recommended to always use the dyn keyword on your trait objects unless your codebase supports compiling with Rust 1.26 or lower. Two trait object types alias each other if the base traits alias each other and if the sets of auto traits are the same and the lifetime bounds are the same. For example, dyn Trait + Send + UnwindSafe is the same as dyn Trait + Unwindsafe + Send . Warning: With two trait object types, even when the complete set of traits is the same, if the base traits differ, the type is different. For example, dyn Send + Sync is a different type from dyn Sync + Send . See issue 33140 . Due to the opaqueness of which concrete type the value is of, trait objects are dynamically sized types . Like all DSTs, trait objects are used behind some type of pointer; for example &dyn SomeTrait or Box<dyn SomeTrait> . Each instance of a pointer to a trait object includes: a pointer to an instance of a type T that implements SomeTrait a virtual method table , often just called a vtable , which contains, for each method of SomeTrait and its supertraits that T implements, a pointer to T 's implementation (i.e. a function pointer). The purpose of trait objects is to permit \"late binding\" of methods. Calling a method on a trait object results in virtual dispatch at runtime: that is, a function pointer is loaded from the trait object vtable and invoked indirectly. The actual implementation for each vtable entry can vary on an object-by-object basis.

The rules for pub restrictions are as follows: pub(in path) makes an item visible within the provided path . path must be a parent module of the item whose visibility is being declared. pub(crate) makes an item visible within the current crate. pub(super) makes an item visible to the parent module. This is equivalent to pub(in super) . pub(self) makes an item visible to the current module. This is equivalent to pub(in self) .

Because this is a public directive, this allows the item to be used in the current module through the rules above. It essentially allows public access into the re-exported item. For example, this program is valid: pub use self::implementation::api; mod implementation { pub mod api { pub fn f() {} }\n} # fn main() {} This means that any external crate referencing implementation::api::f would receive a privacy violation, while the path api::f would be allowed. When re-exporting a private item, it can be thought of as allowing the \"privacy chain\" being short-circuited through the reexport instead of passing through the namespace hierarchy as it normally would.","breadcrumbs":"Items and attributes » Re-exporting and Visibility","id":"visibility-and-privacy.html#re-exporting-and-visibility","title":"Re-exporting and Visibility"},"visibility-and-privacy.html#visibility-and-privacy":{"body":"Syntax Visibility : pub | pub ( crate ) | pub ( self ) | pub ( super ) | pub ( in SimplePath ) These two terms are often used interchangeably, and what they are attempting to convey is the answer to the question \"Can this item be used at this location?\" Rust's name resolution operates on a global hierarchy of namespaces. Each level in the hierarchy can be thought of as some item. The items are one of those mentioned above, but also include external crates. Declaring or defining a new module can be thought of as inserting a new tree into the hierarchy at the location of the definition. To control whether interfaces can be used across modules, Rust checks each use of an item to see whether it should be allowed or not. This is where privacy warnings are generated, or otherwise \"you used a private item of another module and weren't allowed to.\" By default, everything in Rust is private , with two exceptions: Associated items in a pub Trait are public by default; Enum variants in a pub enum are also public by default. When an item is declared as pub , it can be thought of as being accessible to the outside world. For example: # fn main() {}\n// Declare a private struct\nstruct Foo; // Declare a public struct with a private field\npub struct Bar { field: i32,\n} // Declare a public enum with two public variants\npub enum State { PubliclyAccessibleState, PubliclyAccessibleState2,\n} With the notion of an item being either public or private, Rust allows item accesses in two cases: If an item is public, then it can be accessed externally from some module m if you can access all the item's parent modules from m . You can also potentially be able to name the item through re-exports. See below. If an item is private, it may be accessed by the current module and its descendants. These two cases are surprisingly powerful for creating module hierarchies exposing public APIs while hiding internal implementation details. To help explain, here's a few use cases and what they would entail: A library developer needs to expose functionality to crates which link against their library. As a consequence of the first case, this means that anything which is usable externally must be pub from the root down to the destination item. Any private item in the chain will disallow external accesses. A crate needs a global available \"helper module\" to itself, but it doesn't want to expose the helper module as a public API. To accomplish this, the root of the crate's hierarchy would have a private module which then internally has a \"public API\". Because the entire crate is a descendant of the root, then the entire local crate can access this private module through the second case. When writing unit tests for a module, it's often a common idiom to have an immediate child of the module to-be-tested named mod test . This module could access any items of the parent module through the second case, meaning that internal implementation details could also be seamlessly tested from the child module. In the second case, it mentions that a private item \"can be accessed\" by the current module and its descendants, but the exact meaning of accessing an item depends on what the item is. Accessing a module, for example, would mean looking inside of it (to import more items). On the other hand, accessing a function would mean that it is invoked. Additionally, path expressions and import statements are considered to access an item in the sense that the import/expression is only valid if the destination is in the current visibility scope. Here's an example of a program which exemplifies the three cases outlined above: // This module is private, meaning that no external crate can access this\n// module. Because it is private at the root of this current crate, however, any\n// module in the crate may access any publicly visible item in this module.\nmod crate_helper_module { // This function can be used by anything in the current crate pub fn crate_helper() {} // This function *cannot* be used by anything else in the crate. It is not // publicly visible outside of the `crate_helper_module`, so only this // current module and its descendants may access it. fn implementation_detail() {}\n} // This function is \"public to the root\" meaning that it's available to external\n// crates linking against this one.\npub fn public_api() {} // Similarly to 'public_api', this module is public so external crates may look\n// inside of it.\npub mod submodule { use crate_helper_module; pub fn my_method() { // Any item in the local crate may invoke the helper module's public // interface through a combination of the two rules above. crate_helper_module::crate_helper(); } // This function is hidden to any module which is not a descendant of // `submodule` fn my_implementation() {} #[cfg(test)] mod test { #[test] fn test_my_implementation() { // Because this module is a descendant of `submodule`, it's allowed // to access private items inside of `submodule` without a privacy // violation. super::my_implementation(); } }\n} # fn main() {} For a Rust program to pass the privacy checking pass, all paths must be valid accesses given the two rules above.
