This opt in enables editions to contain incompatible changes, like adding a new keyword that might conflict with identifiers in code, or turning warnings into errors. A Rust compiler will support all editions that existed prior to the compiler's release, and can link crates of any supported editions together. Edition changes only affect the way the compiler initially parses the code. Therefore, if you're using Rust 2015, and one of your dependencies uses Rust 2018, it all works just fine. The opposite situation works as well. Just to be clear: most features will be available on all editions. People using any edition of Rust will continue to see improvements as new stable releases are made. In some cases however, mainly when new keywords are added, but sometimes for other reasons, there may be new features that are only available in later editions. You only need to upgrade if you want to take advantage of such features.","breadcrumbs":"Compatibility","id":"editions/index.html#compatibility","title":"Compatibility"},"editions/index.html#trying-out-the-2018-edition":{"body":"At the time of writing, there are two editions: 2015 and 2018. 2015 is today's Rust; Rust 2018 is currently in beta, and will land in stable in Rust 1.31, on December 6, 2018.

In any programming language, idioms change over time, and Rust is no exception. While old code will continue to compile, it might be written with different idioms today. Our sample code contains an outdated idiom. Here it is again: trait Foo { fn foo(&self, _: Box<Foo>);\n} In Rust 2018, it's considered idiomatic to use the dyn keyword for trait objects. Eventually, we want cargo fix to fix all these idioms automatically in the same manner we did for upgrading to the 2018 edition. Currently, though, the \"idiom lints\" are not ready for widespread automatic fixing. The compiler isn't making cargo fix -compatible suggestions in many cases right now, and it is making incorrect suggestions in others. Enabling the idiom lints, even with cargo fix , is likely to leave your crate either broken or with many warnings still remaining.

As a result the following instructions are recommended only for the intrepid who are willing to work through a few compiler/Cargo bugs! With that out of the way, we can instruct Cargo to fix our code snippet with: $ cargo fix --edition-idioms Afterwards, src/lib.rs looks like this: trait Foo { fn foo(&self, _: Box<dyn Foo>);\n} We're now more idiomatic, and we didn't have to fix our code manually! Note that cargo fix may still not be able to automatically update our code. If cargo fix can't fix something, it will print a warning to the console, and you'll have to fix it manually. As mentioned before, there are known bugs around the idiom lints which means they're not all ready for prime time yet. You may get a scary-looking warning to report a bug to Cargo, which happens whenever a fix proposed by rustc actually caused code to stop compiling by accident. If you'd like cargo fix to make as much progress as possible, even if it causes code to stop compiling, you can execute: $ cargo fix --edition-idioms --broken-code This will instruct cargo fix to apply automatic suggestions regardless of whether they work or not.

This alternate source must be the exact same as the crates.io index. Cargo assumes that replacement sources are exact 1:1 mirrors in this respect, and the following support is designed around that assumption. When generating a lock file for crate using a replacement registry, the original registry will be encoded into the lock file. For example in the configuration above, all lock files will still mention crates.io as the registry that packages originated from. This semantically represents how crates.io is the source of truth for all crates, and this is upheld because all replacements have a 1:1 correspondance.

What does it do? Let's take a step back and talk about how rustc compiles your code. Compilation has many \"passes\", that is, there are many distinct steps that the compiler takes on the road from your source code to producing the final binary. However, you can think of this process in two big steps: first, rustc does all of its safety checks, makes sure your syntax is correct, all that stuff. Second, once it's satisfied that everything is in order, it produces the actual binary code that you end up executing. It turns out that that second step takes a lot of time. And most of the time, it's not neccesary. That is, when you're working on some Rust code, many developers will get into a workflow like this: Write some code. Run cargo build to make sure it compiles. Repeat 1-2 as needed. Run cargo test to make sure your tests pass. Try the binary yourself GOTO 1. In step two, you never actually run your code. You're looking for feedback from the compiler, not to actually run the binary. cargo check supports exactly this use-case: it runs all of the compiler's checks, but doesn't produce the final binary. To use it: $ cargo check where you may normally cargo build . The workflow now looks like: Write some code. Run cargo check to make sure it compiles. Repeat 1-2 as needed.

Data alignment refers to aligning elements according to their natural alignment. To ensure natural alignment, it may be necessary to insert some padding between structure elements or after the last element of a structure. The #[repr] attribute has a new parameter, align , that sets the alignment of your struct: struct Number(i32); assert_eq!(std::mem::align_of::<Number>(), 4);\nassert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Number>(), 4); #[repr(align(16))]\nstruct Align16(i32); assert_eq!(std::mem::align_of::<Align16>(), 16);\nassert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Align16>(), 16); If you’re working with low-level stuff, control of these kinds of things can be very important! The alignment of a type is normally not worried about as the compiler will \"do the right thing\" of picking an appropriate alignment for general use cases. There are situations, however, where a nonstandard alignment may be desired when operating with foreign systems. For example these sorts of situations tend to necessitate or be much easier with a custom alignment: Hardware can often have obscure requirements such as \"this structure is aligned to 32 bytes\" when it in fact is only composed of 4-byte values. While this can typically be manually calculated and managed, it's often also useful to express this as a property of a type to get the compiler to do a little extra work instead. C compilers like gcc and clang offer the ability to specify a custom alignment for structures, and Rust can much more easily interoperate with these types if Rust can also mirror the request for a custom alignment (e.g. passing a structure to C correctly is much easier). Custom alignment can often be used for various tricks here and there and is often convenient as \"let's play around with an implementation\" tool. For example this can be used to statically allocate page tables in a kernel or create an at-least cache-line-sized structure easily for concurrent programming. The purpose of this feature is to provide a lightweight annotation to alter the compiler-inferred alignment of a structure to enable these situations much more easily.","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Data types » Choosing alignment with the repr attribute","id":"rust-2018/data-types/choosing-alignment-with-the-repr-attribute.html#choosing-alignment-with-the-repr-attribute","title":"Choosing alignment with the repr attribute"},"rust-2018/data-types/field-init-shorthand.html#field-init-shorthand":{"body":"Minimum Rust version: 1.17 In older Rust, when initializing a struct, you must always give the full set of key: value pairs for its fields: struct Point { x: i32, y: i32,\n} let a = 5;\nlet b = 6; let p = Point { x: a, y: b,\n}; However, often these variables would have the same names as the fields.

The warning we get when compiling has a hint: warning: literal out of range for u8 --> src/main.rs:6:17 |\n6 | for i in 0..256 { | ^^^ | = note: #[warn(overflowing_literals)] on by default That’s right, since i is a u8 , this overflows, and is the same as writing for i in 0..0 , so the loop executes zero times. We can do this with inclusive ranges, however: fn takes_u8(x: u8) { // ...\n} fn main() { for i in 0..=255 { println!(\"i: {}\", i); takes_u8(i); }\n} This will produce those 256 lines of output you might have been expecting.","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Data types » ..= for inclusive ranges","id":"rust-2018/data-types/inclusive-ranges.html#a--for-inclusive-ranges","title":"..= for inclusive ranges"},"rust-2018/data-types/index.html#data-types":{"body":"In this chapter of the guide, we discuss a few improvements to data types.

Enums have a “tag” that stores which variant is the correct one at runtime; unions don't have this tag. Since we can interpret the data held in the union using the wrong variant and Rust can’t check this for us, that means reading a union’s field is unsafe: # union MyUnion {\n# f1: u32,\n# f2: f32,\n# }\nlet mut u = MyUnion { f1: 1 }; u.f1 = 5; let value = unsafe { u.f1 }; Pattern matching works too: # union MyUnion {\n# f1: u32,\n# f2: f32,\n# }\nfn f(u: MyUnion) { unsafe { match u { MyUnion { f1: 10 } => { println!(\"ten\"); } MyUnion { f2 } => { println!(\"{}\", f2); } } }\n} When are unions useful? One major use-case is interoperability with C. C APIs can (and depending on the area, often do) expose unions, and so this makes writing API wrappers for those libraries significantly easier. Additionally, unions also simplify Rust implementations of space-efficient or cache-efficient structures relying on value representation, such as machine-word-sized unions using the least-significant bits of aligned pointers to distinguish cases.

Due to an unexpected problem , like an index being out of bounds for an array. Expected problems usually arise from conditions that are outside of your control; robust code should be prepared for anything its environment might throw at it. In Rust, expected problems are handled via the Result type , which allows a function to return information about the problem to its caller, which can then handle the error in a fine-grained way. Unexpected problems are bugs : they arise due to a contract or assertion being violated. Since they are unexpected, it doesn't make sense to handle them in a fine-grained way. Instead, Rust employs a \"fail fast\" approach by panicking , which by default unwinds the stack (running destructors but no other code) of the thread which discovered the error. Other threads continue running, but will discover the panic any time they try to communicate with the panicked thread (whether through channels or shared memory). Panics thus abort execution up to some \"isolation boundary\", with code on the other side of the boundary still able to run, and perhaps to \"recover\" from the panic in some very coarse-grained way. A server, for example, does not necessarily need to go down just because of an assertion failure in one of its threads. It's also worth noting that programs may choose to abort instead of unwind, and so catching panics may not work. If your code relies on catch_unwind , you should add this to your Cargo.toml: [profile.debug]\npanic = \"unwind\" [profile.release]\npanic = \"unwind\" If any of your users choose to abort, they'll get a compile-time failure. The catch_unwind API offers a way to introduce new isolation boundaries within a thread . There are a couple of key motivating examples: Embedding Rust in other languages Abstractions that manage threads Test frameworks, because tests may panic and you don't want that to kill the test runner For the first case, unwinding across a language boundary is undefined behavior, and often leads to segfaults in practice. Allowing panics to be caught means that you can safely expose Rust code via a C API, and translate unwinding into an error on the C side. For the second case, consider a threadpool library. If a thread in the pool panics, you generally don't want to kill the thread itself, but rather catch the panic and communicate it to the client of the pool. The catch_unwind API is paired with resume_unwind , which can then be used to restart the panicking process on the client of the pool, where it belongs. In both cases, you're introducing a new isolation boundary within a thread, and then translating the panic into some other form of error elsewhere.","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Error handling and panics » Controlling panics with std::panic","id":"rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/controlling-panics-with-std-panic.html#controlling-panics-with--stdpanic","title":"Controlling panics with std::panic"},"rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/index.html#error-handling-and-panics":{"body":"In this chapter of the guide, we discuss a few improvements to error handling in Rust.

As an example, you might have tried to write: use std::fs::File; fn main() { let f = File::open(\"bar.txt\")?;\n} Since ? works by propagating the Result with an early return to the enclosing function, the snippet above does not work, and results today in the following error: error[E0277]: the `?` operator can only be used in a function that returns `Result` or `Option` (or another type that implements `std::ops::Try`) --> src/main.rs:5:13 |\n5 | let f = File::open(\"bar.txt\")?; | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot use the `?` operator in a function that returns `()` | = help: the trait `std::ops::Try` is not implemented for `()` = note: required by `std::ops::Try::from_error` To solve this problem in Rust 2015, you might have written something like: // Rust 2015 # use std::process;\n# use std::error::Error; fn run() -> Result<(), Box<Error>> { // real logic..

In Rust 2018 you can instead let your #[test] s and main functions return a Result : // Rust 2018 use std::fs::File; fn main() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> { let f = File::open(\"bar.txt\")?; Ok(())\n} In this case, if say the file doesn't exist and there is an Err(err) somewhere, then main will exit with an error code (not 0 ) and print out a Debug representation of err .","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Error handling and panics » ? in main and tests","id":"rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/question-mark-in-main-and-tests.html#a--in--main--and-tests","title":"? in main and tests"},"rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/question-mark-in-main-and-tests.html#more-details":{"body":"Getting -> Result<..> to work in the context of main and #[test] s is not magic. It is all backed up by a Termination trait which all valid return types of main and testing functions must implement. The trait is defined as: pub trait Termination { fn report(self) -> i32;\n} When setting up the entry point for your application, the compiler will use this trait and call .report() on the Result of the main function you have written. Two simplified example implementations of this trait for Result and () are: # #![feature(process_exitcode_placeholder, termination_trait_lib)]\n# use std::process::ExitCode;\n# use std::fmt;\n#\n# pub trait Termination { fn report(self) -> i32; } impl Termination for () { fn report(self) -> i32 { # use std::process::Termination; ExitCode::SUCCESS.report() }\n} impl<E: fmt::Debug> Termination for Result<(), E> { fn report(self) -> i32 { match self { Ok(()) => ().report(), Err(err) => { eprintln!(\"Error: {:?}\", err); # use std::process::Termination; ExitCode::FAILURE.report() } } }\n} As you can see in the case of () , a success code is simply returned.

It does this by solving one simple problem. To illustrate, imagine we had some code to read some data from a file: # use std::{io::{self, prelude::*}, fs::File};\nfn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> { let f = File::open(\"username.txt\"); let mut f = match f { Ok(file) => file, Err(e) => return Err(e), }; let mut s = String::new(); match f.read_to_string(&mut s) { Ok(_) => Ok(s), Err(e) => Err(e), }\n} Note: this code could be made simpler with a single call to std::fs::read_to_string , but we're writing it all out manually here to have an example with multiple errors. This code has two paths that can fail, opening the file and reading the data from it. If either of these fail to work, we'd like to return an error from read_username_from_file . Doing so involves match ing on the result of the I/O operations. In simple cases like this though, where we are only propagating errors up the call stack, the matching is just boilerplate - seeing it written out, in the same pattern every time, doesn't provide the reader with a great deal of useful information. With ? , the above code looks like this: # use std::{io::{self, prelude::*}, fs::File};\nfn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> { let mut f = File::open(\"username.txt\")?; let mut s = String::new(); f.read_to_string(&mut s)?; Ok(s)\n} The ? is shorthand for the entire match statements we wrote earlier. In other words, ? applies to a Result value, and if it was an Ok , it unwraps it and gives the inner value. If it was an Err , it returns from the function you're currently in. Visually, it is much more straightforward. Instead of an entire match statement, now we are just using the single \"?\" character to indicate that here we are handling errors in the standard way, by passing them up the call stack. Seasoned Rustaceans may recognize that this is the same as the try! macro that's been available since Rust 1.0 . And indeed, they are the same. Previously, read_username_from_file could have been implemented like this: # use std::{io::{self, prelude::*}, fs::File};\nfn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> { let mut f = try!(File::open(\"username.txt\")); let mut s = String::new(); try!(f.read_to_string(&mut s)); Ok(s)\n} So why extend the language when we already have a macro? There are multiple reasons. First, try! has proved to be extremely useful, and is used often in idiomatic Rust. It is used so often that we think it's worth having a sweet syntax. This sort of evolution is one of the great advantages of a powerful macro system: speculative extensions to the language syntax can be prototyped and iterated on without modifying the language itself, and in return, macros that turn out to be especially useful can indicate missing language features. This evolution, from try! to ? is a great example. One of the reasons try! needs a sweeter syntax is that it is quite unattractive when multiple invocations of try! are used in succession. Consider: try!(try!(try!(foo()).bar()).baz()) as opposed to foo()?.bar()?.baz()? The first is quite difficult to scan visually, and each layer of error handling prefixes the expression with an additional call to try! . This brings undue attention to the trivial error propagation, obscuring the main code path, in this example the calls to foo , bar and baz . This sort of method chaining with error handling occurs in situations like the builder pattern. Finally, the dedicated syntax will make it easier in the future to produce nicer error messages tailored specifically to ? , whereas it is difficult to produce nice errors for macro-expanded code generally. You can use ? with Result<T, E> s, but also with Option<T> . In that case, ? will return a value for Some(T) and return None for None . One current restriction is that you cannot use ? for both in the same function, as the return type needs to match the type you use ? on. In the future, this restriction will be lifted.","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Error handling and panics » The ? operator for easier error handling","id":"rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html#the----operator-for-easier-error-handling","title":"The ? operator for easier error handling"},"rust-2018/index.html#rust-2018":{"body":"The edition system was created for the release of Rust 2018.

This can make supporting both versions of rust more complicated. For example, let's make a simplified (and slightly contrived) version of the log crate in 2015 edition style: use std::fmt; /// How important/severe the log message is.\n#[derive(Copy, Clone)]\npub enum LogLevel { Warn, Error\n} impl fmt::Display for LogLevel { fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result { match self { LogLevel::Warn => write!(f, \"warning\"), LogLevel::Error => write!(f, \"error\"), } }\n} // A helper macro to log the message.\n#[doc(hidden)]\n#[macro_export]\nmacro_rules! __impl_log { ($level:expr, $msg:expr) => {{ println!(\"{}: {}\", $level, $msg) }}\n} /// Warn level log message\n#[macro_export]\nmacro_rules! warn { ($($args:tt)*) => { __impl_log!($crate::LogLevel::Warn, format_args!($($args)*)) }\n} /// Error level log message\n#[macro_export]\nmacro_rules! error { ($($args:tt)*) => { __impl_log!($crate::LogLevel::Error, format_args!($($args)*)) }\n} Our __impl_log! macro is private to our module, but needs to be exported as it is called by other macros, and in 2015 edition all used macros must be exported. Now, in 2018 this example will not compile: use log::error; fn main() { error!(\"error message\");\n} will give an error message about not finding the __impl_log! macro. This is because unlike in the 2015 edition, macros are namespaced and we must import them. We could do use log::{__impl_log, error}; which would make our code compile, but __impl_log is meant to be an implementation detail! Macros with $crate:: prefix. The cleanest way to handle this situation is to use the $crate:: prefix for macros, the same as you would for any other path. Versions of the compiler >= 1.30 will handle this in both editions: macro_rules! warn { ($($args:tt)*) => { $crate::__impl_log!($crate::LogLevel::Warn, format_args!($($args)*)) }\n} // ... However, this will not work for older versions of the compiler that don't understand the $crate:: prefix for macros. Macros using local_inner_macros We also have the local_inner_macros modifier that we can add to our #[macro_export] attribute. This has the advantage of working with older rustc versions (older versions just ignore the extra modifier). The downside is that it's a bit messier: #[macro_export(local_inner_macros)]\nmacro_rules! warn { ($($args:tt)*) => { __impl_log!($crate::LogLevel::Warn, format_args!($($args)*)) }\n} So the code knows to look for any macros used locally. But wait - this won't compile, because we use the format_args! macro that isn't in our local crate (hence the convoluted example). The solution is to add a level of indirection: we create a macro that wraps format_args , but is local to our crate. That way everything works in both editions (sadly we have to pollute the global namespace a bit, but that's ok). // I've used the pattern `_<my crate name>__<macro name>` to name this macro, hopefully avoiding\n// name clashes.\n#[doc(hidden)]\n#[macro_export]\nmacro_rules! _log__format_args { ($($inner:tt)*) => { format_args! { $($inner)* } }\n} Here we're using the most general macro pattern possible, a list of token trees. We just pass whatever tokens we get to the inner macro, and rely on it to report errors. So the full 2015/2018 working example would be: use std::fmt; /// How important/severe the log message is.\n#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]\npub enum LogLevel { Warn, Error\n} impl fmt::Display for LogLevel { fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result { match self { LogLevel::Warn => write!(f, \"warning\"), LogLevel::Error => write!(f, \"error\"), } }\n} // A helper macro to log the message.\n#[doc(hidden)]\n#[macro_export]\nmacro_rules! __impl_log { ($level:expr, $msg:expr) => {{ println!(\"{}: {}\", $level, $msg) }}\n} /// Warn level log message\n#[macro_export(local_inner_macros)]\nmacro_rules! warn { ($($args:tt)*) => { __impl_log!($crate::LogLevel::Warn, _log__format_args!($($args)*)) }\n} /// Error level log message\n#[macro_export(local_inner_macros)]\nmacro_rules! error { ($($args:tt)*) => { __impl_log!($crate::LogLevel::Error, _log__format_args!($($args)*)) }\n} #[doc(hidden)]\n#[macro_export]\nmacro_rules! _log__format_args { ($($inner:tt)*) => { format_args! { $($inner)* } }\n} Once everyone is using a rustc version >= 1.30, we can all just use the $crate:: method (2015 crates are guaranteed to carry on compiling fine with later versions of the compiler). We need to wait for package managers and larger organisations to update their compilers before this happens, so in the mean time we can use the local_inner_macros method to support everybody. :)","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Macros » Local helper macros","id":"rust-2018/macros/macro-changes.html#local-helper-macros","title":"Local helper macros"},"rust-2018/macros/macro-changes.html#macro-changes":{"body":"Minimum Rust version: beta","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Macros » Macro changes","id":"rust-2018/macros/macro-changes.html#macro-changes","title":"Macro changes"},"rust-2018/macros/macro-changes.html#macro_rules--style-macros":{"body":"In Rust 2018, you can import specific macros from external crates via use statements, rather than the old #[macro_use] attribute.

As such, the 2018 edition of Rust introduces a few new module system features, but they end up simplifying the module system, to make it more clear as to what is going on. Here's a brief summary: extern crate is no longer needed in 99% of circumstances. The crate keyword refers to the current crate. Absolute paths begin with a crate name, where the keyword crate refers to the current crate. A foo.rs and foo/ subdirectory may coexist; mod.rs is no longer needed when placing submodules in a subdirectory. These may seem like arbitrary new rules when put this way, but the mental model is now significantly simplified overall. Read on for more details!

The uniform paths variant of Rust 2018 simplifies and unifies path handling compared to Rust 2015. In Rust 2015, paths work differently in use declarations than they do elsewhere. In particular, paths in use declarations would always start from the crate root, while paths in other code implicitly started from the current module. Those differences didn't have any effect in the top-level module, which meant that everything would seem straightforward until working on a project large enough to have submodules. In the uniform paths variant of Rust 2018, paths in use declarations and in other code always work the same way, both in the top-level module and in any submodule. You can always use a relative path from the current module, a path starting from an external crate name, or a path starting with crate , super , or self . Code that looked like this: // Rust 2015 extern crate futures; use futures::Future; mod foo { pub struct Bar;\n} use foo::Bar; fn my_poll() -> futures::Poll { ... } enum SomeEnum { V1(usize), V2(String),\n} fn func() { let five = std::sync::Arc::new(5); use SomeEnum::*; match ... { V1(i) => { ... } V2(s) => { ... } }\n} will look exactly the same in Rust 2018, except that you can delete the extern crate line: // Rust 2018 (uniform paths variant) use futures::Future; mod foo { pub struct Bar;\n} use foo::Bar; fn my_poll() -> futures::Poll { ... } enum SomeEnum { V1(usize), V2(String),\n} fn func() { let five = std::sync::Arc::new(5); use SomeEnum::*; match ... { V1(i) => { ... } V2(s) => { ... } }\n} With Rust 2018, however, the same code will also work completely unmodified in a submodule: // Rust 2018 (uniform paths variant) mod submodule { use futures::Future; mod foo { pub struct Bar; } use foo::Bar; fn my_poll() -> futures::Poll { ... } enum SomeEnum { V1(usize), V2(String), } fn func() { let five = std::sync::Arc::new(5); use SomeEnum::*; match ... { V1(i) => { ... } V2(s) => { ... } } }\n} This makes it easy to move code around in a project, and avoids introducing additional complexity to multi-module projects. If a path is ambiguous, such as if you have an external crate and a local module or item with the same name, you'll get an error, and you'll need to either rename one of the conflicting names or explicitly disambiguate the path.

More formally, patterns have a \"binding mode,\" which is either by value ( x ), by reference ( ref x ), or by mutable reference ( ref mut x ). In Rust 2015, match always started in by-value mode, and required you to explicitly write ref or ref mut in patterns to switch to a borrowing mode. In Rust 2018, the type of the value being matched informs the binding mode, so that if you match against an &Option<String> with a Some variant, you are put into ref mode automatically, giving you a borrowed view of the internal data.

SIMD stands for “single instruction, multiple data.” Consider a function like this: pub fn foo(a: &[u8], b: &[u8], c: &mut [u8]) { for ((a, b), c) in a.iter().zip(b).zip(c) { *c = *a + *b; }\n} Here, we’re taking two slices, and adding the numbers together, placing the result in a third slice. The simplest possible way to do this would be to do exactly what the code does, and loop through each set of elements, add them together, and store it in the result. However, compilers can often do better. LLVM will usually “autovectorize” code like this, which is a fancy term for “use SIMD.” Imagine that a and b were both 16 elements long. Each element is a u8 , and so that means that each slice would be 128 bits of data. Using SIMD, we could put both a and b into 128 bit registers, add them together in a single instruction, and then copy the resulting 128 bits into c . That’d be much faster! While stable Rust has always been able to take advantage of autovectorization, sometimes, the compiler just isn’t smart enough to realize that we can do something like this. Additionally, not every CPU has these features, and so LLVM may not use them so your program can be used on a wide variety of hardware. The std::arch module allows us to use these kinds of instructions directly, which means we don’t need to rely on a smart compiler. Additionally, it includes some features that allow us to choose a particular implementation based on various criteria. For example: #[cfg(all(any(target_arch = \"x86\", target_arch = \"x86_64\"), target_feature = \"avx2\"))]\nfn foo() { #[cfg(target_arch = \"x86\")] use std::arch::x86::_mm256_add_epi64; #[cfg(target_arch = \"x86_64\")] use std::arch::x86_64::_mm256_add_epi64; unsafe { _mm256_add_epi64(...); }\n} Here, we use cfg flags to choose the correct version based on the machine we’re targeting; on x86 we use that version, and on x86_64 we use its version. We can also choose at runtime: fn foo() { #[cfg(any(target_arch = \"x86\", target_arch = \"x86_64\"))] { if is_x86_feature_detected!(\"avx2\") { return unsafe { foo_avx2() }; } } foo_fallback();\n} Here, we have two versions of the function: one which uses AVX2, a specific kind of SIMD feature that lets you do 256-bit operations. The is_x86_feature_detected! macro will generate code that detects if your CPU supports AVX2, and if so, calls the foo_avx2 function. If not, then we fall back to a non-AVX implementation, foo_fallback. This means that our code will run super fast on CPUs that support AVX2, but still work on ones that don’t, albeit slower. If all of this seems a bit low-level and fiddly, well, it is! std::arch is specifically primitives for building these kinds of things. We hope to eventually stabilize a std::simd module with higher-level stuff in the future. But landing the basics now lets the ecosystem experiment with higher level libraries starting today. For example, check out the faster crate. Here’s a code snippet with no SIMD: let lots_of_3s = (&[-123.456f32; 128][..]).iter() .map(|v| { 9.0 * v.abs().sqrt().sqrt().recip().ceil().sqrt() - 4.0 - 2.0 }) .collect::<Vec<f32>>(); To use SIMD with this code via faster, you’d change it to this: let lots_of_3s = (&[-123.456f32; 128][..]).simd_iter() .simd_map(f32s(0.0), |v| { f32s(9.0) * v.abs().sqrt().rsqrt().ceil().sqrt() - f32s(4.0) - f32s(2.0) }) .scalar_collect(); It looks almost the same: simd_iter instead of iter , simd_map instead of map , f32s(2.0) instead of 2.0 . But you get a SIMD-ified version generated for you. Beyond that, you may never write any of this yourself, but as always, the libraries you depend on may. For example, the regex crate contains these SIMD speedups without you needing to do anything at all!","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » SIMD for faster computing","id":"rust-2018/simd-for-faster-computing.html#simd-for-faster-computing","title":"SIMD for faster computing"},"rust-2018/slice-patterns.html#arrays-and-exact-lengths":{"body":"In the second example above, since arrays in Rust are of known lengths, we have to match on exactly three elements.

While that post goes into the details, the idea is basically this: when you’re working on a project, you often compile it, then change something small, then compile again. Historically, the compiler has compiled your entire project, no matter how little you’ve changed the code. The idea with incremental compilation is that you only need to compile the code you’ve actually changed, which means that that second build is faster. This is now turned on by default. This means that your builds should be faster! Don’t forget about cargo check when trying to get the lowest possible build times. This is still not the end story for compiler performance generally, nor incremental compilation specifically. We have a lot more work planned in the future. One small note about this change: it makes builds faster, but makes the final binary a bit slower.

Rust 1.20 adds the ability to define “associated constants” as well: struct Struct; impl Struct { const ID: u32 = 0;\n} fn main() { println!(\"the ID of Struct is: {}\", Struct::ID);\n} That is, the constant ID is associated with Struct . Like functions, associated constants work with traits and enums as well. Traits have an extra ability with associated constants that gives them some extra power. With a trait, you can use an associated constant in the same way you’d use an associated type: by declaring it, but not giving it a value. The implementor of the trait then declares its value upon implementation: trait Trait { const ID: u32;\n} struct Struct; impl Trait for Struct { const ID: u32 = 5;\n} fn main() { println!(\"{}\", Struct::ID);\n} Before this feature, if you wanted to make a trait that represented floating point numbers, you’d have to write this: trait Float { fn nan() -> Self; fn infinity() -> Self; // ...\n} This is slightly unwieldy, but more importantly, because they’re functions, they cannot be used in constant expressions, even though they only return a constant. Because of this, a design for Float would also have to include constants as well: mod f32 { const NAN: f32 = 0.0f32 / 0.0f32; const INFINITY: f32 = 1.0f32 / 0.0f32; impl Float for f32 { fn nan() -> Self { f32::NAN } fn infinity() -> Self { f32::INFINITY } }\n} Associated constants let you do this in a much cleaner way. This trait definition: trait Float { const NAN: Self; const INFINITY: Self; // ...\n} Leads to this implementation: mod f32 { impl Float for f32 { const NAN: f32 = 0.0f32 / 0.0f32; const INFINITY: f32 = 1.0f32 / 0.0f32; }\n} much cleaner, and more versatile.","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Trait system » Associated constants","id":"rust-2018/trait-system/associated-constants.html#associated-constants","title":"Associated constants"},"rust-2018/trait-system/dyn-trait-for-trait-objects.html#dyn-trait--for-trait-objects":{"body":"Minimum Rust version: 1.27 The dyn Trait feature is the new syntax for using trait objects.
